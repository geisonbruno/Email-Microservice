This project is a Microservice built using **Java, Java Spring, MySQL as a database.**

# About the project
___
This microservice is designed to centralize the sending of emails to any service within a microservices architecture. Using the Spring Boot framework together with Spring Email, it offers a robust and efficient solution for managing email communications.

Initially, the microservice was configured to operate with Gmail's SMTP, handling requests synchronously through a REST API. To increase efficiency and handle scalable demands, it has been evolved to support asynchronous processing, using RabbitMQ for message management.
